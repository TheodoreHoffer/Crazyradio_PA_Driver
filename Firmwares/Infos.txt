If you just received the crazyradio PA, you probably should flash its firmware.
To do so, use the following command:

sudo python ../usb-flash.py cradio-pa-0.53.bin


Here are the VendorId/ProductID when the Crazyradio is correctly flashed

1915:7777: regular Crazyradio firmware
1915:0101: bootloader mode
1915:0102: mousejacked
nothing: fix with SPI
